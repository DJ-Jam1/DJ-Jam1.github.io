								<h3>Ideation</h3>
								<p>When first starting this project I started with asking questions about what players wanted/expected this led to the creation of the Goals and Pillars that I could use to guide me through development.
									With this I was able to better inform my research to fit my Goals and Pillars which are below.

								<ol>
									<li><b>Life of the nomad</b> everything must be useful nothing is wasted </li>
									<li><b>  Fear</b> I must make my enemies fear me to get what I want</li>
									<li><b> Opportunity</b> The timing must be perfect or I risk losing everything</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Research & Documentation</h3>
								
								<p>
									With clear goals set, development was able to proceed starting with research for factions and characters to add to the project.
									After research I started prioritising characters that where must haves as they would be characters that players would recognise and learning how to add them in-engine. 
									After the core characters where added I moved to designing and prototyping the faction mechanics in-engine which was core to not only the gameplay loop but also the player experiece.
									After first implementation I conducted a small feedback session to see if my player experience goals were being achieved and iterating where needed. This proved vital and allowed for further balancing before release.
								</p>
								<p>
									After Both Charcters and Faction Mechanics etc had been added then the focussed my attention on progression and implementation of a narrative for the faction which I had roughly laid out in my inital pass, 
									but this needed fleshing out further to create a more compelling experience.
